* make scroll bar always visible, but disabled when page is too small


Ways to generalize refreshWall (eventlistener and callable function (no parameters)):

Finding email for browse
 * Use sessionstorage for browse context ("whose wall are we refreshing again?")
 * save context in sessionStorage or relevant object data member

 *** When we browse users, on successful search, store data object in sessionStorage - "lastSearch"

determining which wall to refresh (eventlistener dispatcher)
* using dom nav (aunt/uncle element)
* if event.target  == home_refresh
elseif ... browse_refresh
* save context in sessionStorage or relevant object data member
